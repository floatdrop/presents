Hello, my name is Vsevolod Strukchinsky and I'm presenting Social Network Game For Cognitive Researches.

This subject is a bit old for researching, but nowadays we can see shifting people communication and interactions in social networks.

Cognitive experiments is about researching human perception and processing of external information. This can be achived through magnit resonance tomogramm or by studying people decision within some tasks.

There is famous experiment, called "Stanford prison experiment", which was about finding out, what drive yours decisions - your personality or situation, that you were put in.

Of course there are more experiments, which is more human friendly, than putting half participiants in the gail and other half as a guards.

Our goal is to reimplement Turing Test experiment with some modifications. One of them is that participants do not know about current experiments, that is running on a platform. This will prevent them from intentionally spoil the results.

As you know, common Turing Test uses open text communication. We suggest, that this gives huge advance to human, which can use quizzez or paradoxes. So first modification of Turing Test is restrict language set to subset of commands. 

Second modification is every one is a judge. Participiants must decide by them selfs with whom they should cooperate. And last one - you loose points if you cooperate with robots.

For this test we are developed unified platform, that can be easly deployed onto social networks or even work without them. Our high priority task is to keep platform easy to maintain and change by not only by us, but with help of other students and researches.

We are deployed our application in VKontakte social network for developing and testing, but same technics (called IFrame application) avaliable for Facebook as well. At this point we collecting only data that cannot be classified as personal.

With significant amount of data we look to analyze how people communicate with restricted language. Results of this research can be used to improve non-player character communication and make them more human like.

Also we have future experiments to work on - like Traveling Sales Man problem.

Thank you for your attention!
